## Project Overview

This portfolio is implemented as a **Single Page Application (SPA)** leveraging React‚Äôs component-based architecture. It delivers an intuitive UI/UX optimized for desktop and mobile devices, with state-of-the-art frontend technologies and tooling.

The goal: present my professional profile with **fast load times, accessibility, and maintainable code**‚Äîall crucial for a strong developer portfolio.

---

## Technical Architecture

- **React (v19) with JavaScript**  
  Strong typing enhances maintainability, scalability, and developer productivity. Functional components with hooks drive UI logic and state management.

- **TailwindCSS**  
  Utility-first CSS framework for modular, responsive styling with minimal CSS file sizes. Dark mode support implemented with Tailwind‚Äôs theming.

- **Vite**  
  Modern, lightning-fast development server and build tool leveraging ES modules, resulting in near-instant hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized production builds.

- **Lucide Icons & Radix UI Primitives**  
  Lightweight, accessible UI primitives and iconography for consistent visual language and ARIA-compliant interactive components.

- **Form Handling & Notifications**  
  Efficient form state management and validation with React Hook Form. Toast notifications provide user feedback for contact form submissions.

- **EmailJS Integration**  
  Secure, client-side email sending for contact form without backend dependency.

- **Routing**  
  `react-router-dom` enables scalable and maintainable page structure. Smooth in-page navigation is handled via native anchor links and CSS scroll behavior.

## Key Features

- **Dark/Light Mode with Persistent Theme Preference** ‚Äî Local storage backed with seamless UI transitions.  
- **Animated Interactive Backgrounds** ‚Äî Optimised CSS and React-based animations for engaging UI without compromising performance.  
- **Responsive Design & Accessibility** ‚Äî Mobile-first approach with ARIA roles and keyboard navigation support.  
- **Project Showcase** ‚Äî Dynamically rendered project cards with tech stack tags and GitHub/demo links.  
- **Contact Form with Real-Time Validation & Notifications** ‚Äî Enhances user engagement and lead capture.  
- **One-Click Deployment via GitHub Pages** ‚Äî Fully automated deployment using `gh-pages` package and Vite build outputs.  


---

## Development Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/harishanan/harishanan-portfolio.git
cd harishanan-portfolio
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Runs the app locally with Vite on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
- Hot module replacement ensures immediate reflection of code changes.
- Linting and formatting via ESLint and Prettier (configurable).

---

## Build & Deployment

### Production Build

```
npm run build
```

- Generates highly optimized static assets in the `/dist` directory.  
- Assets are minified, code-split, and cache-busted for maximum performance.

### GitHub Pages Deployment

- Uses `gh-pages` npm package for deploying the `/dist` directory to the `gh-pages` branch.  
- Configure `vite.config.ts` with appropriate `base` path matching the GitHub Pages repo URL.  
- Deployment script example in `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
}
```

- Run **npm run deploy** to publish updates seamlessly.

## ‚úÖProject Highlights

### Fast Load Times
- **Vite:** Your app uses Vite, a modern frontend build tool known for fast dev server startup and optimized production builds.  
- **Code-splitting & Caching:** Vite‚Äôs production build includes tree-shaking, minification, and cache-busting file names.  
- **GitHub Pages:** Hosting on GitHub Pages provides good CDN-level performance for static sites.

### Accessibility
- **Radix UI Primitives:** These are designed with accessibility in mind‚Äîensuring ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.  
- **Responsive Design:** Your TailwindCSS-based layout adjusts well across devices.  
- **Clear Structure & Contrast:** The use of dark/light mode, semantic sections (Hero, Projects, Contact), and visible interactive elements all help with accessibility.  


### Maintainable Code
- **Component-Based Architecture (React):** Easy to reuse and update sections like Hero, Projects, etc.  
- **Tailwind CSS:** Keeps styling atomic and inside components, avoiding messy CSS files.  
- **ESLint & Prettier:** Included for code quality and consistent formatting.  
- **Modular File Structure:** Logical file grouping helps onboard others or future-you.

## ‚ôøAccessibility Note

**ARIA-compliant** refers to following the **Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)** standards, as defined by the [WAI-ARIA specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/).

In simple terms, ARIA-compliant interactive components are:

- **Accessible to screen readers** ‚Äî allowing visually impaired users to understand and navigate the interface.
- **Keyboard-navigable** ‚Äî ensuring functionality without relying on a mouse.
- **Informative to assistive technologies** ‚Äî exposing roles, states, and labels for better usability.

Using tools like **Radix UI** ensures that components are built with accessibility best practices in mind, reducing barriers and improving UX for all users.
